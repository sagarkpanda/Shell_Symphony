## What’s Shell:
In simple terms shell is a program that takes input as commands and passes the operating system (OS) to perform the desired task.

In linux we have many shell programs such as bash, zsh, fish and etc. We are going to use bash in this series.

What's Bash:
The “Bourne again shell” is a replacement and brings a lot of improvement over the original bourne shell. In modern days most of the linux distributions use bash by default.

Why use Shell scripting:
The shell scripting contains the commands we can use without a script also.

But say we want to run a set command everyday, so instead of running them repeatedly, we can create a script and run it reducing our task.

We can also run the script on a scheduled basis hence achieving automation.
